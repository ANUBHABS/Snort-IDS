The Snort DAQ library has a prerequisite that needed to be installed first -
    ● sudo apt-get install -y bison flex
    (bison and flex are needed here to parse text data in Linux)
    Then
    ● cd ~/snort_src
    ● wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/daq-2.0.6.tar.gz (Download the daq-2.0.6.tar.gz
    package)
    ● tar -xvzf daq-2.0.6.tag.gz
    ● cd daq-2.0.6/
    ● ./configure
    ● make
    ● sudo make install
