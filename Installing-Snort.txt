  
Before installation of snort -
    sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev openssl libssl-dev
  
Now download and install snort -
    cd ~/snort_src
    wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/snort-2.9.15.1.tag.gz
    tar -xvzf snort-2.9.15.1.tar.gz
    cd snort-2.9.15.1/
    ./configure --enable-sourcefire
    make
    sudo make install
    
Now check the snort version -
    snort -V
    
Create the Snort directories -
    sudo mkdir /etc/snort
    sudo mkdir /etc/snort/rules
    sudo mkdir /etc/snort/iplists
    sudo mkdir /etc/snort/preproc_rules
    sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules
    sudo mkdir /etc/snort/so_rules
    
Create some files that stores rules and iplists -
    sudo touch /etc/snort/rules/iplists/black_list.rules
    sudo touch /etc/snort/rules/iplists/white_list.rules
    sudo touch /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
    sudo touch /etc/snort/sid-msg.map

Create our logging directories -
    sudo mkdir /var/log/snort
    (Everytime when we run the snort we found one
    pcap file here as log. And all the components
    whatever used in the snort rule will reflect in
    this pcap file)
    sudo mkdir/var/log/snort/archived_logs
    
    cd ~/snort_src/snort-2,9.15.1/etc
    sudo cp *.conf* /etc/snort
    sudo cp *.map /etc/snort
    sudo cp *.dtd /etc/snort
    cd ~/snort_src/snort-2.9.15.1/src/dynamic-preprocessors/build/usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicpreprocessor/
    cd cp * /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicprepocessor
