For application traffic detection we use ‘tcpreplay’ for replaying the previously captured traffic in a pcap
file.

    ● We can do tcpreplay from another Ubuntu vm setting the interface to the snort vm (or) we can just do
    tcpreplay from same Ubuntu vm where snort is installed using the localhost interface.
    
    ● Installation process of tcpreplay -
        wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpreplay/files/tcpreplay/4.3.2/tcpreplay-4.3.2.tar.gz
        tar xf tcpreplay-4.3.2.tar.gz
        cd tcpreplay-4.3.2/
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        tcpreplay -V (for checking the version)
