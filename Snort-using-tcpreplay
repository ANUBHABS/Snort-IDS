● Here we use the localhost interface.

● To validate any snort rule -
    ■ sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i lo
    
● To run the Snort -
    ■ sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i lo
    
● To run the tcpreplay -
    ■ sudo tcpreplay -i lo <pcap file name>
    
● Here we can also use different flags in the tcpreplay command -
    -t -> for sending the application traffic in full speed
    -K -> the .pcap is first pre-loaded in the memory (next field is pcap file name)
    --loop 500 -> for looping 500 times (we can use any loop count)
    lo -> localhost interface (check by typing ifconfig)
    Example -> sudo tcpreplay -i lo -t -K --loop 500 --unique-ip example.pcap
