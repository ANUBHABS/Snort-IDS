Everytime before running the Snort we have to first validate the Snort rule.

    ● There has a file called snort.conf in the /etc/snort/snort.conf directory.
        sudo gedit /etc/snort/snort.conf
        
    It’s the snort configuration file . Here we have to define all network addresses ,
    paths for the RULE_PATH, SO_RULE_PATH, PREPROC_RULE_PATH,
    BLACK_LIST_PATH and WHITE_LIST_PATH,
    and the path for the local.rules path where the snort rules are present.
    
    ● To validate the snort rule -
        sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i <interface name>
