All the snort rules will be present inside the /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
    sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules    
    
● Here, we can comment out any rule by including ‘#’ at the beginning of the rule.

● For any types of protocol(TCP, ICMP, FTP) testing we can just ping the Ubuntu machine where snort is
  installed from outside(any other Ubuntu m/c or windows)
  
● And to test the Snort rule -
    sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i <interface name>
    
● If it executes fine we will see the alert message present in the snort rule on the terminal. And also we’ll
  find one pcap file as log inside the /var/log/snort directory
